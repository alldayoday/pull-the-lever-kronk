# Pull The Lever, Kronk!

### This project is an *Emperor's New Groove* themed slot machine game. Inspired by the Disney Classic, this game allows the player to imagine they are in Kronk's shoes, attempting to pull the lever and hope that it all comes together. Simply click to pull the lever, and wait to see your result. I was inspired to create this game because I love *Emperor's New Groove* and any time I think of a lever, my mind goes straight to Kronk.

## Game Deployment
* https://pull-the-lever-kronk.surge.sh/
* Please note that the title will say that you have pulled the wrong lever. This is not an indication that you have selected the wrong button to click, it is simply the correct reference to the film the game is based on. You should be clicking the button that says "Pull Lever".

## Technologies Used:
Project created with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Future Enchancements 
Add a pawn shop option where players can select an item in their posession to sell directly to the casino in order to keep playing.
